    "The big value of an autoencoder model is that we can predict a client vector in a single pass over just that client's ratings. This is great for real-time use cases and for scaling training: inferring a new client vector with a trained model is trivially parallelizeable. This is not the case at all in our current latent MF models, which need to see all the data to update client vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Encoder**. We encode ratings slightly differently than normal. Instead of saying +1 for a positive rating and -1 for a negative rating, we now categorically encode every combination of item and rating type. So if item=1 gets a 0.0 rating we use item_code=0, but if the same item=1 gets a different 1.0 rating we use a different item_code=1. MovieLens has ratings from 0.0 to 5.0 This means the *encoder* learns an embedding for (item_id=1, rating=0.0) and a new embedding for (item_id=1, rating=3.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Representation.** This creates a user vector from features (as in autoencoders) rather than memorizing one that recreates features (as in latent / PGM models). This user vector is constructed by matrix multiplying the sparse user-item ratings matrix $R_{ui}$ (of shape n_users x n_items) with a dense item vector matrix $Q_{ik}$ (of shape n_items x k dimensions). \n",
    "\n",
    "    $v = R \\cdot Q / n$ \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In practice we don't materialize the whole sparse $R$ matrix, but take chunks of rows. This follows the typical deep learning paradigm of minibatch training.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We do the same to compute a user bias from rated items' biases. Here, $B$ is the item bias tensor of shape (n_items, 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $b = R \\cdot B / n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The $n$ normalizes the user vectors and biases.  If you look carefully, $R \\cdot Q$ and $R \\cdot B$  are the *sum* of item vectors and biases for all items a single user rated. We want the average, so divide that user's rating count $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling**. Mask the encoder ratings. By randomly masking half the ratings in any given iteration we're basically stochastically doing feature bagging and sampling. Because each iteration is random, over many epochs we'll still see all the data -- we're not downsampling. On the decoder, where we measure the likelihood of the data, we're not randomly sampling the data (maybe we should). I haven't tested whether this actually effective -- just a guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoder.** The 'decoder' is in charge of using the user vector $v$ and the user bias $b$ to compute the likelihood. This procedes as a normal latent variable model. We add the user biases $b$ with decoder-specific item biases $c_i$ and interact the user vector $v$ generated in the encoder in the last step with decoder-specific item embedding $t_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $R_{i} \\sim b + v \\cdot t_i + c_i$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that here we learn a new decoder-specific item embedding $t_i$. This is completely distinct from the (item_id, rating id) embeddings we defined in the encoder. That means a single item has five encoder vectors (one for each of the five ratings) and has yet another representation in the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings in previous autoencoders are shuffled. A single player may appear in the first batch and in the last batch of the same epoch. But in this model, we get user \"blocks\" of ratings -- a single user's ratings all fit into the same batch. That's because within each minibatch we want to compute a client vector from all of it's ratings at once.\n",
    "- Validation as defined here isn't really what we want. The validation error is encoding a client's ratings into a compressed latent vector and then measuring the *reconstruction* loss. That's not quite what we want -- we want to give it half of a user's ratings and have it predict the reconstruction of the missing half, caring less about how well it recovers the given first half."
